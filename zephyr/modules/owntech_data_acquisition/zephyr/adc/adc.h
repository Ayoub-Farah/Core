 *
 * @brief  This is an ad-hoc ADC driver for OwnTech's
 * application. It supports differential channel setup
 * unlike Zephyr's STM32 driver.
 * It configures ADC 1 and ADC 2, using a common clock
 * which is AHB clock with a prescaler division by 4.
 * ADC 3 is also enabled independently.
 *
 * To use this driver, first call adc_init(), then call
 * required configuration functions, then call adc_start().
 *
 * This file is the entry point of the ADC management.
 * Only this header file provides public functions for the
 * ADC. No other header from this folder should be included
 * in files outside this folder.
