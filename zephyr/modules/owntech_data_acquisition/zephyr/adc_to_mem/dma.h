 *         DMA 1 is used for all acquisitions, with channel n
 *         acquiring values from ADC n.

/**
 * This function configures a channel from DMA 1
 * to transfer measures  from an ADC to buffers,
 * then starts the channels.
 * It must only be called after all the ADCs configuration
 * has been carried out, as it uses its channels
 * configuration to determine the size of the buffers.
 *
 * @param adc_number Number of the ADC to acquire measures from.
 * @param enable_double_buffering Boolean indicating whether
 *        double buffering is to be activated.
 *        - If false, the buffer will be treated as a single buffer with
 *          interrupt being triggered only when it is full.
 *        - If true the buffer will be treated as two consecutive sub-buffers,
 *          with interrupt being triggered as soon as a sub-buffer is full.
 * @param buffer Pointer to buffer.
 * @param buffer_size Size of the buffer in bytes.
